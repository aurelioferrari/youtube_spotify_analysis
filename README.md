<p>First, I wanted to check which Album Type would be the most popular one.</p>
<p>For that, a pizza graph was created.</p>

Now for the most views on Youtube and stream on Spotify, the graphs show which the top 10 artists.

`Observation 1` - Ed Sheeran is the top Artist on Youtube, but the Second one on Spotify.</p>
`Observation 2` - Dua Lipa is not in the top 10 on Youtube, but is top 3 on Spotify.

Now comparing the Songs with the biggest number of likes and views, I got this:

`Observation 3` - Despacito is the most viewed and liked song.</p>
`Observation 4` - Lean on is in 3rd place in views, but in 9th when it comes to likes.

And lastly, the top 10 artists with most likes are shown in the image below:

`Observation 5` - Although Despacito is the song with more likes, Luis Fonsi is the 10th.</p>
`Observation 6` - BTS and Blackpink have a major advantage in relation to the 3rd place.
